Of course. Now that your project is running on PostgreSQL, your `README.md` needs to reflect those changes so new collaborators can get set up correctly.

Here is the updated version of your `README.md` file. It's been edited to include instructions for PostgreSQL and Sequelize instead of MongoDB and Mongoose.

You can copy and paste this entire block into your `README.md` file.

# Full-Stack POS Prototype (PostgreSQL, Express, Vue, Node)

A full-stack Point of Sales application built with PostgreSQL, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js. This guide will help you get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* **Node.js** (v18 or later recommended)
* **npm** (comes with Node.js)
* **Git**
* **PostgreSQL:** You need a local PostgreSQL server running.
    * **Windows:** Download the installer from [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).
    * **Mac:** The easiest way is with [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/).
    * During installation, you'll set a password for the `postgres` user. Remember it!
    * After installation, use a tool like **pgAdmin** or `psql` to create a new, empty database for this project (e.g., `pos_prototype`).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git)
cd your-project-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
This project has separate dependencies for the backend server and the frontend client. You'll need to install them in both directories.

* **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

* **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client 
    npm install
    ```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
The backend server requires a `.env` file to connect to your PostgreSQL database.

1.  Navigate to the `server` directory.
2.  Create a new file named `.env`. You can copy the example file if one exists (`cp .env.example .env`).
3.  Open the new `.env` file and add your PostgreSQL connection string. Replace the placeholders with your own local database credentials.
4. If you are using supabase, please choose "Transaction Pooler" for the database URL.
    ```
    # PostgreSQL Connection URL
    # Format: postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:your_password_here@localhost:5432/pos_prototype
    
    # Port for the Express server
    PORT=5000
    ```

---
## Running the Application

To run the full application, you will need to start both the backend and frontend servers. It's best to use **two separate terminal windows** for this.

### Terminal 1: Run the Backend Server
```bash
cd server
node server.js
```
Your backend API should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Terminal 2: Run the Frontend Client
```bash
cd client
npm run serve
```
Your Vue.js frontend should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
